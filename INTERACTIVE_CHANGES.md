# Interactive Change Application

## ✅ Problem Solved: Tool Now Asks for User Confirmation!

The Spring migration tool now **interactively asks you** whether to apply migration changes, instead of running silently or requiring command-line flags.

## How It Works Now

### **1. Analysis Phase (Automatic)**
The tool runs the migration analysis and generates:
- ✅ Migration plan with phases
- ✅ Specific code changes needed  
- ✅ Backup of original files
- ✅ Migration workspace with proper directory structure

### **2. Interactive Prompt (NEW!)**
After analysis completes, you'll see:

```
🤔 Migration Plan Generated:
   📋 4 migration phases identified
   🔧 23 specific changes identified
      • Jakarta Migration: 15 changes
      • Spring Security Updates: 5 changes  
      • Dependency Updates: 3 changes

❓ Would you like to apply the migration changes?
   📁 Target directory: /path/to/project_migration_20241220_143022
   🛡️  Backup created: Yes (in /path/to/project_backup_20241220_143022)
   🔄 Git integration: ✅

🔧 Apply migration changes? [y/N]: 
```

### **3. User Decision**
- **Press 'y' or 'yes'**: Tool applies the changes immediately
- **Press 'n', 'no', or Enter**: Tool completes analysis without applying changes

### **4. Change Application (If Approved)**
When you say "yes":
- ✅ Applies automatic changes (import replacements, etc.)
- ⏭️ Skips manual changes (marked for review)
- 📝 Creates git branch and stages changes (if git integration enabled)
- 📊 Shows detailed summary of what was applied

## Command Line Options

### **Option 1: Interactive Mode (Default - NEW!)**
```bash
python main.py --dir /path/to/spring/project
```
- Runs analysis, then **asks** if you want to apply changes
- Safest option for first-time users

### **Option 2: Auto-Apply Mode**
```bash  
python main.py --dir /path/to/spring/project --apply-changes
```
- Runs analysis and automatically applies changes without asking
- Good for CI/CD or when you're confident

### **Option 3: Analysis-Only Mode**
```bash
python main.py --dir /path/to/spring/project --quick-analysis
```
- Just generates reports, never applies changes
- Good for understanding scope before committing

## What Gets Applied vs Skipped

### **✅ Automatically Applied:**
- `javax.*` → `jakarta.*` import replacements
- Simple configuration updates
- Version number updates in build files
- Basic Spring Security configuration changes

### **⏭️ Skipped for Manual Review:**
- Complex business logic changes
- Custom security configurations  
- Database schema modifications
- Third-party integration updates

## Safety Features

### **🛡️ Backup Protection**
- Original files backed up before any changes
- Backup location clearly shown in prompt
- Easy rollback if issues occur

### **📁 Migration Workspace**
- Changes applied to separate directory with proper structure
- Original project remains untouched
- Easy to review changes before copying back

### **🔄 Git Integration** 
- Creates dedicated migration branch
- Stages changes for easy review
- Provides commands for next steps

## Example Session

```bash
$ python main.py --dir /path/to/my-spring-app
